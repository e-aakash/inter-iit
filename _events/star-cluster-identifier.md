The problem will involve data analysis and inference from dataset(s) for a globular star cluster. The datasets would have the coordinates, color index (for different wavelengths) and magnitude of every star in the cluster. The task would involve using the datasets appropriately to analyze the globular cluster to determine some parameters and peculiarities of the same. Theoretical information necessary for understanding the cluster dynamics will be provided during the hackathon. Standard scientific computing and plotting softwares and packages like MATLAB, Numpy or Matplotlib will be sufficient for the task.

A team of 4 shall work on the dataset on the day of event. This will be a low-prep event and shall carry 150 event points.
